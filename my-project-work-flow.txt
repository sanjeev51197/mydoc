*DOCTOR APPOINTMENT BOOKING*
----------------------------


(First day)---------------------------------->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


1.created spring starter web project  

added  dependency firstly 

spring web
MySQL 
spring data jpa
Eureka Discovery Client (port no 9761)


2.Opened File in IntelliJ

3.Created basic Package 
                      
                      1.Entity    ->
                                   
                                    a.Doctor
                                    b.State   (Mapped ManyToOne and added join column
                                              in Doctor and made a foregin Key because
                                               many doctor belongs to one State)

                                    c.City (same mapping) 
                                    d.Area (same mapping)


                      2.Repository  ->
                                               a. DoctorRepositroy (added the @Query to find the doctor based
                                                                    on city or specialization)
                                               b. StateRepository
                                               c. AreaRepository
                                               d. CityRepository
                      3.Service
                      4.controller

4.Added MySQL properties Jpa Properties Hibernate Properties in Application.properties file.. add server.port=8081
5.Run the main class and table has created in local database.



                                            2nd Day
                                   -----------------------------

Search Operation for the Doctor..
----------------------------------
1.manually open the database 
and add 3-4 data the details in all the table   and in URL section gave dummy url right now.. click apply .

now search should be based on City and area both .
add city and area both query to find in Doctor Repository.

2.Create a SearchController in controller package. and added @RestController and @RequestMapping("/api/v1/doctor")

   @GetMapping("/search")
3. added ResponseEntity that will give List of doctors. and added @RequestParam String specialization 
                                                                 @RequestParam String area

4. Autowired the DoctorRepository.

search

=================================================================================================================================== 


2nd MicroService (Patient) 
Now Patient will Search the Doctor and he'll do the Booking..

--------------------------------------------------------------------

1.Create Spring starter web Project 
                                   
                                   group - com.patient-service
                                   artifactid - patient-service
                                   Name- patient-service
                                   package- com.patient-service..

2. package            1.Entity    ->
                                   
                                    a.Patient
                                    b.State   (Mapped ManyToOne and added join column
                                              in Patient and made a foregin Key because
                                               many Pateint belongs to one State)

                                    c.City (same mapping) 
                                    d.Area (same mapping)


                      2.Repository  ->
                                               a. PatientRepositroy                                                                  
                    
                      3.service
                      4.controller
                      5.exception




notes
----
Relation between doctor and appointment schedule  -> one doctor can have appointment on many date.

and One Date can have multiple time slots.......   

Relationship tree
------------------------------------------                  
           Doctor
                  |
                   ---DoctorAppointmentSchedule(date) 
                              |
                               ------TimeSlots(time)

we have done bidirectional mapping that everyone knows eachother.........

to stop the recursive action to avoid unlimited details ..
we ll use jsonbackreference and jsonmanagereference

to search for the Doctor based on dates and times we will build

in Doctor-service entity package
                              1.DoctorAppointmentSchedule  class   this will have LocalDate date;
                              2.TimeSlots  class   this will have LocalTime time;


The Patient will search the doctor he'll sign up
for that we build patient service microservice ...........
we added the port no 8082 and another patient_db we created..

Now the logic is 

               One doctor will have many patient 
               and one patient will have manydoctors.       manytomany relation..


but we are using microservice so we can easily avoid this conflicts ..by using appointment-service

Now we are using sql join to obtain the matching records from the doctor , doctorappointmentschedule and timeslots..
Inner join we'll use the which will give matching records from both the table;

so when we do bidirectional mapping whichever table that they know it will fetch all the details.

===========================================================================================================================

Day-3 

Applied current and future date concept in search Controller .
--------------------------------------------------------------
by using LocalTime .
isEqual()  method =current time
iAfter()  = future time
isBefore()= previous time.

because patient will search only the future or current time..................


Day-4
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                     
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


now added eureka  microservice with dependency added eureka discovery.

now in application.properties added
server.port=8761
eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false
eureka.client.fetch-registry=false


now in main application of eureka 
added
@EnableEurekaServer

and run the Eureka Application.
after running started doctor-service and patient-service application to add in Eureka Server.


Now .............

created booking-service microservice 
added dependencies-
                   openFiegn  - to intercommunicate between the patientservice to doctor service and payment gateway.
                   EurekaDiscoveryClient
                   spring web
                   spring data jpa
                   spring Boot dev tools
                   MySQL Driver


EnabledDiscoveryClient to add the service with Eureka

now in doctor-service 

in searchController

create a method to get the doctor details.. it will directly return doctor details not in response or json.

//http://localhost:8080/api/v1/doctor/getdoctorbyid?id=1
getMapping("/getdoctorid) ..................


now from bookingcontroller i will call the method .
for that we need to @Enableopenfiegnclient in booking-service application.

feign client is  used to call one microservice from another microservice..

now created doctorfiegnclient interface

@FeignClient(name = "doctor-service",url = "http://localhost:8081/api/v1/doctor")
public interface DoctorClient {
      
        @GetMapping("/getdoctorbyid")
        Doctor getDoctorById(@RequestParam long id);             this is the same method where you created in Doctor-Service in controller.

}

created Doctor dto in dto pacage and added all the information simply copy pasted and removed unwanted annotation...

here Doctor is the Dto of dto pacage.


now from BookingController created a method to getthedoctorbyid

       @Autowired
       private DoctorClient doctorClient;

    //http://localhost:8085/api/v1/booking/getdoctor?id=1
            @GetMapping("/getdoctor")
            public Doctor getDoctorById(@RequestParam long id)
            {
                return doctorClient.getDoctorById(1);
            }

start all your service first and run..

..........................................................
                   
5th Day
===========================================================================================================================
in Booking controller

in every doctor details one book button will be there. 
now suppose. moment you click on booking button then two things will go to the backend.
1.doctorid
2.patientid

we need actual doctor from database that why we have changed the parameter to actual doctorId.

now we have added @RequestParam long patientId in the getdoctorbyid method ..
and also  changed the getmapping url and added &patientId=1

.............................................................................................................
Now we need to create a PatientController class
and get the patientbyid details object directly...

 @GetMapping("/getpatientbyid)
        public Patient getPatientById(@Requestparam long id)
        {
            return patientRepository.findById(id).get();
        }
            

after getting the patientobject.
we have bulid a patientclient interface in our booking-service annotated with @FeignClients(name="patient-service",url="with patient service port) 


 @GetMapping("/getpatientbyid")
    public Patient getPatientById(@RequestParam long id);


now we require patientDto. because whatever response we get .we have to store somewhere.
created dto package and just copied the entity of patient from patient-service to dto of booking-service.

and removed all the annotations.
and imports.

after that in bookingcontroller. when clicking on book button both doctor and patient details required so 
for now we are returning the value in String.
stored both doctor in d var 
and patient in p var.

started and running all the services.


=======================================================================================================================================

Day -6 
=========================================================================================================================================
Create payment-service maven microservice and added 
dependencies-> spring web 
             ->  Eureka Discovery CLient
              -> Stripe Dependency

Stripe -We are using now for testing purpose
=======
Stripe is a payment gateway — a platform that lets you accept online payments safely and easily.
It handles all the hard parts like:
talking to banks and credit card networks,
ensuring security and encryption,
managing refunds, subscriptions, invoices, etc.

Once we logged in to the account.
->>>>>>>> Copy the Secret Key.

Created Dto Package
===================
added        -> ProductRequest class     -  
             -> StripeResponse class
what is ProductRequest?
ProductRequest is a Data Transfer Object (DTO) —
a simple Java class that represents what data the API needs from the client when creating a Stripe checkout session.
public class ProductRequest {
    private Long amount;
    private long quantity;
    private String name;
    private String currency;
    // getters & setters
}

StripeResponse
==============
public class StripeResponse {

    private String status;
    private String message;
    private String sessionId;
    private String sessionUrl;
}

If ProductRequest is the input, then StripeResponse is the output.

When you call your backend endpoint (like /create-checkout-session):
You send a request with details (→ ProductRequest)
The backend calls Stripe API
Stripe sends back a response with info like payment URL, session ID, status, etc.
Your backend then sends that info to the frontend (→ StripeResponse)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Service Package
==============
create StripeService
set the secretKey with adding @Value annotation. which takes the value from application.properties file where we set
spring.application.name=payment-service
server.port=5555
stripe.secretKey=sk_test_**********************************8

🔍 Step-by-step explanation
============================
| Step                         | What happens                                     | Example                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **1️⃣ Set API Key**          | Stripe SDK needs your secret key to authenticate | `Stripe.apiKey = "sk_test_..."`       |
| **2️⃣ Build Session Params** | You tell Stripe what the user is buying          | name, amount, currency                |
| **3️⃣ Create Session**       | Stripe returns a secure payment page URL         | `https://checkout.stripe.com/pay/...` |
| **4️⃣ Return Response**      | You wrap it in `StripeResponse` for frontend     | includes `sessionId` + `sessionUrl`   |

the Service will create unique session for every payment req .
when user will click on Checkout.. User get the option to make proceed with payment along with the productdetails.that we set.
then the payment.Mode will come and it will get stored in params variable.  
now when you are in paymentmode for that one session id will be created
once you click on submit you get a paymentUrl with afterclickon it .. u get success msg after completion.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Created ProductCheckoutController
---------------------------------
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/product/v1")
public class ProductCheckoutController {

    @Autowired
    private StripeService stripeService;

    @PostMapping("/checkout")
    public ResponseEntity<StripeResponse> checkoutProducts(@RequestBody ProductRequest  productRequest)
    {
      StripeResponse stripeResponse=  stripeService.checkoutProducts(productRequest);
       return ResponseEntity
               .status(HttpStatus.OK)
               .body(stripeResponse);


    }
}
=================================================================================================================================
after that use postman body
{
   "amount":50000,
   "quantity":2,
   "name":"nike shoes",
   "currency":"USD"

}
you will get url click and add card details ..... 4242 4242 4242 4242   05/28 / 846      -> submit

====================================================================================================================================
Day-7        -Updation of Booking Details if the payment is successful
Payment Success Message. in Controller we are going to do.


In Booking-service 
created a BookingConfirmation class in entity package . and gave the details which i want after payment success.in page.

Now in BookingController.
   @GetMapping("/getdoctor")
            public String getDoctorById(
                    @RequestParam long doctorId,
                    @RequestParam long patientId,
                    @RequestParam LocalDate date,
                    @RequestParam LocalTime time)

comparing date and time and if availave then booking happens.
we added if condition  using equals() to match the date and time.  
 
List<DoctorAppointmentSchedule> appointmentSchedules = d.getAppointmentSchedules();
        for (DoctorAppointmentSchedule app : appointmentSchedules) {
            LocalDate localDate = app.getDate();
            if (localDate.isEqual(date)) {
                List<TimeSlots> timeSlots = app.getTimeSlots();
                for (TimeSlots t : timeSlots) {
                    if (timeSlots.equals(time)) {
                        System.out.println("Complete Booking");
                    }
                }
            }
           
        }

========================================================
