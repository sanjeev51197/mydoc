Apache Kafka
___________

-> It acts as mediator to exchange messages (Message Broker)
-> Kafka is very useful for real time data exchange
-> Publisher will publish the message and subscriber will consume the message

It helps systems communicate by sending messages (events) between producers and consumers asynchronously.
