AWS
---------------------------------

EBS ->
EBS = Elastic Block Store
Think of it like a hard disk (or SSD) that you attach to your EC2 instance.

Just like your laptop needs a hard drive to store files, your EC2 instance (virtual machine) needs storage — that’s EBS.

💾 Simple Analogy ---------------------

🖥️ EC2 instance → your computer
💽 EBS volume → your computer’s hard drive

When you stop or restart your computer (EC2), the hard drive (EBS) still keeps all your data safe.



note-
The volume that is automatically created is called root volume

steps to create and attach volume.

Create instance ->  the zone whherevyour instance is. The EBS should be in the same zone.........

now create the volume 
and select the same zone where your server is..  
give the name of the volume.
select the volume and in actions -> attach the volume.

now to check the storage 
first in pem file open gitbash terminal
paste the instance url
and click yes

now in command 
type  -> lsblk (to verify disk space)

now to create a folder in external disk and add some file ->

----------------------------------------------------------------

first verify the disk using lsblk...........
then get the disk name in left corner

now to create a file system ..........that is format the disk now it is 
available to store the data.
---------------------------------------------------------------
-> sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/nvme1n1    hit enter
-> now go back to pwd thst is ec2

-> cd ~
-> pwd
-> mkdir psa  (creating psa directory)
-> ls -l  (to check folder)
-> sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1 psa   ( to mount the device)

-> sudo touch A.txt B.txt (to create file in psa folder

-> cd ~ ( go back to ec2)

- > lsblk (check the device) 

 -----------------------------------------------------------

note-
seven types of storage in aws.
IOPs-  input output operation per second
throughput - how much amount of data i can write it per second.
