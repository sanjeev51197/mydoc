AWS
---------------------------------

EBS ->
EBS = Elastic Block Store
Think of it like a hard disk (or SSD) that you attach to your EC2 instance.

Just like your laptop needs a hard drive to store files, your EC2 instance (virtual machine) needs storage — that’s EBS.

💾 Simple Analogy ---------------------

🖥️ EC2 instance → your computer
💽 EBS volume → your computer’s hard drive

When you stop or restart your computer (EC2), the hard drive (EBS) still keeps all your data safe.



note-
The volume that is automatically created is called root volume

steps to create and attach volume.

Create instance ->  the zone whherevyour instance is. The EBS should be in the same zone.........

now create the volume 
and select the same zone where your server is..  
give the name of the volume.
select the volume and in actions -> attach the volume.

now to check the storage 
first in pem file open gitbash terminal
paste the instance url
and click yes

now in command 
type  -> lsblk (to verify disk space)

now to create a folder in external disk and add some file ->

----------------------------------------------------------------

first verify the disk using lsblk...........
then get the disk name in left corner

now to create a file system ..........that is format the disk now it is 
available to store the data.
---------------------------------------------------------------
-> sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/nvme1n1    hit enter
-> now go back to pwd thst is ec2

-> cd ~
-> pwd
-> mkdir psa  (creating psa directory)
-> ls -l  (to check folder)
-> sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1 psa   ( to mount the device)

-> sudo touch A.txt B.txt (to create file in psa folder

-> cd ~ ( go back to ec2)

- > lsblk (check the device) 

 -----------------------------------------------------------
note-
seven types of storage in aws.
IOPs-  input output operation per second
throughput - how much amount of data i can write it per second.

What is a Snapshot in AWS?

A Snapshot in AWS is basically a backup — a point-in-time copy of your EBS volume (your EC2’s storage disk).

Think of it like taking a photo of your hard drive — so if anything goes wrong, you can restore your data from that photo later.

🧠 Simple Analogy

Imagine your EBS volume is your notebook 📒.
When you take a snapshot, it’s like taking a photo of all the pages.
If you lose the notebook (EBS volume), you can print a new one from the photo (snapshot).


💬 1️⃣ What is a Load Balancer in AWS?
--------------------------------------
🗣️ Answer:

A Load Balancer in AWS automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to ensure no single instance is overloaded.
It helps with high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance.

💡 (If you want to sound practical)

For example, if I have 3 EC2 servers running my website, the Load Balancer will send users to whichever server is healthy and free.



💬 3️⃣ What is a Target Group?
--------------------------------
🗣️ Answer:

A Target Group is a set of EC2 instances or containers where the Load Balancer sends the traffic.
It also performs health checks on targets to ensure only healthy ones receive requests.

9️⃣ Real-life example question:

🧑‍💼 “Suppose your website suddenly gets a lot of users, how will AWS handle it?”

🗣️ Answer:

I’ll put my EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer.
It will automatically distribute traffic among all instances, and if one fails, traffic will move to healthy ones.
We can also use Auto Scaling to launch more instances when traffic increases.


steps to create Load Balancer
--------------------------------

create two instance and give user data......

create target group..........

make inbound traffic allow http 80port open

add instances both in target group

create load balancer ..
 
copy the dns and check ..

make sure s should not be thre in url

keep http only not https....................

------------------------------------------------------------------------------



      **************AUTO SCALING*******************************

AWS automatically add or remove servers based on traffic.
That’s called Auto Scaling

🧠 What is Auto Scaling in AWS?
------------------------------------
Definition (simple):

Auto Scaling automatically increases or decreases the number of EC2 instances in your application based on demand.

It ensures:
✅ High availability (always enough instances)
✅ Cost efficiency (no extra running servers when not needed)

🧩 What is a Launch Template?
-------------------------------
Think of a Launch Template as a blueprint for creating EC2 instances.
It tells AWS how each new instance should look.

🧠 Example:

When Auto Scaling wants to launch a new instance, it needs:

AMI ID (your OS/image)

Instance type (e.g., t2.micro)

Key pair

Security group

User data script (optional)

IAM role

Instead of setting this manually each time, you save all of it in a Launch Template 💡


...
Steps to Create a AUTO SCALING

firstly create a template that is blueprint of ec2 instance.
go to autoscaling and create group..............

-------------------------------------------------------------

now to check if one ec2 instances goes down .. another automatically creates...

-----------------------------------------------------------------

USER DATA-----
------------------

#!/bin/bash
# Update packages
sudo yum update -y

# Install Apache (httpd)
sudo yum install -y httpd

# Enable Apache to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable httpd

# Start Apache service
sudo systemctl start httpd

# Create a simple HTML page
echo "<html><body><h1>Welcome to my static Website!</h1></body></html>" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html


COPY AND PASTE WHILE LAUNCHING INSTANCE--

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Routing..........................via rule

practical 

create two instance flight 1 and  flight 2 
create hotel 1 and hotel 2 andd addthe user data too..

create 2 target group   -  flight   
                        -  hotel
create a load balancer name mmt(makemytrip) 
add the target group 
and register now manage the rules -> add rules -> set the path -> query string key type value hotel or flight 
add priority 1

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


            ************RDS******************************** 27.16 vdo

RDS in AWS?
🗣️ “RDS is a managed relational database service by AWS that supports multiple database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. It automates setup, backup, scaling, and maintenance so developers can focus on applications instead of managing databases.”

1️⃣ Create RDS (MySQL example)

Go to AWS Console → RDS → Create database

Choose Standard Create

Engine: MySQL

Version: 8.0

Templates: Free tier (if just learning)

DB instance identifier: mydb

Master username: admin

Master password: admin12345

Storage: 20 GB

Connectivity:

Choose your VPC

Public access: Yes (for learning)

Create new security group

2️⃣ Edit Security Groups

In your RDS security group, allow inbound:

Type: MySQL/Aurora

Port: 3306

Source: EC2’s security group or 0.0.0.0/0 (for test only ⚠️)




3️⃣ Connect to Database
-----------------------
Spring Boot application.properties:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://<rds-endpoint>:3306/mydb
spring.datasource.username=admin
spring.datasource.password=admin12345
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect

                          < ------- ------- S3 ------------------------------ ->
Q1. What is Amazon S3?
➡️ “Amazon S3 is an object storage service that lets you store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the internet. It’s highly durable, scalable, and secure.”


advantage ->
1.we can upload the file
2.We can host the static website.     
how you host static website ->
 steps ->
created two web pages 
   index.html  this will run first when we paste the url
   error.htlm  if something goes wrong in url .this will run

create a bucket with unique name
enable ACL
untick the publick bucket access 
bucket created .
now upload the both files in the bucket.
now go to bucket ->properties->host static website ->edit->first website name ->second website name-> done.
now scroll now you will get the url. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are storage classes in S3?
➡️ “S3 has different storage classes depending on cost and access frequency.”

Storage Class	Use Case
Standard	Frequently accessed data
Standard-IA	Infrequently accessed
One Zone-IA	Infrequently accessed, one availability zone
Glacier	Archival, long-term storage
Glacier Deep Archive	Cheapest, long-term archive

Q8. What’s the difference between S3 and EBS?
--------------------------------------------
Feature	S3	EBS
Type	Object storage	Block storage
Access	Over internet	Attached to EC2
Use case	Backups, media, static websites	Boot volumes, databases


Q9. How can you make S3 cost-effective?
➡️ “By using lifecycle rules to move old files to Glacier or delete unused versions automatically.”

Q10. What happens when you delete a versioned object?
➡️ “A delete marker is added, and older versions can still be restored.”

Q5. What is S3 versioning?
➡️ “It keeps multiple versions of an object in the same bucket — useful for recovering accidentally deleted or overwritten data.”

Q4. How is data secured in S3?
➡️ “Using IAM policies, bucket policies, ACLs, encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS), and versioning for data protection.”

⚡ What is S3 Transfer Acceleration?

S3 Transfer Acceleration (TA) makes uploads and downloads to S3 faster, especially when your users are far away from the S3 bucket’s region.

It does this by using Amazon CloudFront’s global edge network.



💨 How it works:
------------------------------------------------------------
When you enable Transfer Acceleration on your S3 bucket,
AWS creates a special accelerated endpoint:

https://<bucket-name>.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com


When you upload a file to that endpoint,
your data is sent to the nearest AWS edge location (like Mumbai, London, Tokyo...).

Then AWS’s optimized internal network carries it the rest of the way to your bucket’s region — super fast! 🚀


🧪 When to Use It
===========================================================================================================
✅ Use it when:

You have global users uploading to a central bucket.

Files are large (videos, backups, etc.).

You want faster uploads/downloads from distant locations.

🚫 Don’t use it when:
===========================================================================================
All your users are near the same region as your S3 bucket (won’t help much).

You want to save cost (it’s slightly more expensive).


💬 Interview-Ready Answer

Q: What is S3 Transfer Acceleration?
A: S3 Transfer Acceleration uses Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations to speed up uploads and downloads to S3. Instead of sending data directly to the S3 region, data first goes to the nearest edge location and then travels through AWS’s high-speed private network to the S3 bucket. It’s useful for large files or users far from the bucket’s region.

🧠 Bonus: How to Enable It

Go to your S3 bucket → Properties → Transfer Acceleration.

Click Enable.

Use the new endpoint:
https://<bucket-name>.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com

                           ************************** MFA ***********************************************************



🧠 What is MFA?

MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) means using two different types of security checks to log in.
AWS uses this to add an extra layer of protection to your account.


🧱 Types of MFA in AWS:
-------------------------
| Type                                     | Description                           | Example                                         |

               ********************************   IAM    *************************************


🧠 What is IAM?
---------------------
IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service in AWS that helps you securely control access to AWS resources.

👉 It decides who can access what and how they can access it.

💬 Simple Definition:

IAM allows you to create and manage users, groups, roles, and policies to control permissions in your AWS environment.


🧱 IAM Components (Like Lego Pieces)
------------------------------------
| Component     | Meaning                                                 | Example                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 👤 **User**   | A person or application that logs in to AWS             | A developer named “Rohan”             |

| 👥 **Group**  | A collection of users with same permissions             | “Developers” group with EC2 access    |

| 🎭 **Role**   | Temporary permissions assigned to AWS services or users | EC2 role that allows access to S3     |

| 📜 **Policy** | A document that defines permissions (in JSON)           | “Allow user to read/write S3 buckets” |
