AWS
---------------------------------

EBS ->
EBS = Elastic Block Store
Think of it like a hard disk (or SSD) that you attach to your EC2 instance.

Just like your laptop needs a hard drive to store files, your EC2 instance (virtual machine) needs storage — that’s EBS.

💾 Simple Analogy ---------------------

🖥️ EC2 instance → your computer
💽 EBS volume → your computer’s hard drive

When you stop or restart your computer (EC2), the hard drive (EBS) still keeps all your data safe.



note-
The volume that is automatically created is called root volume

steps to create and attach volume.

Create instance ->  the zone whherevyour instance is. The EBS should be in the same zone.........

now create the volume 
and select the same zone where your server is..  
give the name of the volume.
select the volume and in actions -> attach the volume.

now to check the storage 
first in pem file open gitbash terminal
paste the instance url
and click yes

now in command 
type  -> lsblk (to verify disk space)

now to create a folder in external disk and add some file ->

----------------------------------------------------------------

first verify the disk using lsblk...........
then get the disk name in left corner

now to create a file system ..........that is format the disk now it is 
available to store the data.
---------------------------------------------------------------
-> sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/nvme1n1    hit enter
-> now go back to pwd thst is ec2

-> cd ~
-> pwd
-> mkdir psa  (creating psa directory)
-> ls -l  (to check folder)
-> sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1 psa   ( to mount the device)

-> sudo touch A.txt B.txt (to create file in psa folder

-> cd ~ ( go back to ec2)

- > lsblk (check the device) 

 -----------------------------------------------------------
note-
seven types of storage in aws.
IOPs-  input output operation per second
throughput - how much amount of data i can write it per second.

What is a Snapshot in AWS?

A Snapshot in AWS is basically a backup — a point-in-time copy of your EBS volume (your EC2’s storage disk).

Think of it like taking a photo of your hard drive — so if anything goes wrong, you can restore your data from that photo later.

🧠 Simple Analogy

Imagine your EBS volume is your notebook 📒.
When you take a snapshot, it’s like taking a photo of all the pages.
If you lose the notebook (EBS volume), you can print a new one from the photo (snapshot).


💬 1️⃣ What is a Load Balancer in AWS?
--------------------------------------
🗣️ Answer:

A Load Balancer in AWS automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to ensure no single instance is overloaded.
It helps with high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance.

💡 (If you want to sound practical)

For example, if I have 3 EC2 servers running my website, the Load Balancer will send users to whichever server is healthy and free.



💬 3️⃣ What is a Target Group?
--------------------------------
🗣️ Answer:

A Target Group is a set of EC2 instances or containers where the Load Balancer sends the traffic.
It also performs health checks on targets to ensure only healthy ones receive requests.

9️⃣ Real-life example question:

🧑‍💼 “Suppose your website suddenly gets a lot of users, how will AWS handle it?”

🗣️ Answer:

I’ll put my EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer.
It will automatically distribute traffic among all instances, and if one fails, traffic will move to healthy ones.
We can also use Auto Scaling to launch more instances when traffic increases.


steps to create Load Balancer
--------------------------------

create two instance and give user data......

create target group..........

make inbound traffic allow http 80port open

add instances both in target group

create load balancer ..
 
copy the dns and check ..

make sure s should not be thre in url

keep http only not https....................

------------------------------------------------------------------------------



      **************AUTO SCALING*******************************

AWS automatically add or remove servers based on traffic.
That’s called Auto Scaling

🧠 What is Auto Scaling in AWS?
------------------------------------
Definition (simple):

Auto Scaling automatically increases or decreases the number of EC2 instances in your application based on demand.

It ensures:
✅ High availability (always enough instances)
✅ Cost efficiency (no extra running servers when not needed)

🧩 What is a Launch Template?
-------------------------------
Think of a Launch Template as a blueprint for creating EC2 instances.
It tells AWS how each new instance should look.

🧠 Example:

When Auto Scaling wants to launch a new instance, it needs:

AMI ID (your OS/image)

Instance type (e.g., t2.micro)

Key pair

Security group

User data script (optional)

IAM role

Instead of setting this manually each time, you save all of it in a Launch Template 💡


...
Steps to Create a AUTO SCALING

firstly create a template that is blueprint of ec2 instance.
go to autoscaling and create group..............

-------------------------------------------------------------

now to check if one ec2 instances goes down .. another automatically creates...
